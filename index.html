				<p>As a Computer Science major at Florida International University, I am driven by a passion for
					transforming innovative ideas into reality through the use of cutting-edge technologies and
					frameworks. My expertise spans multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript,
					and C, which I have employed to develop sophisticated web applications, robust data pipelines, and
					advanced machine learning models. I have honed my skills with industry-standard tools such as
					React.js for dynamic front-end development, GraphQL for efficient data querying, Docker for
					containerized environments, TensorFlow for deep learning, and Pandas for data manipulation, enabling
					me to deliver impactful and scalable solutions.</p>

				<h2>World Kinect Corporation</h2>
				<p>Currently, I am working as a Software Engineering Intern at World Kinect Corporation
					, where I develop and implement automated QA testing procedures for the company's authentication and
					authorization system (Auth0), ensuring robust security and compliance across multiple APIs using
					Karate and Postman. I create and maintain automated test scripts for GraphQL endpoints, enhancing
					the reliability and efficiency of our API management system. By integrating automation into CI/CD
					pipelines, I save the company weeks of manual testing time and accelerate software releases.
					Additionally, I led the transition from REST to GraphQL architecture, streamlining API management
					and improving performance. My role involves hands-on experience with modern authentication systems
					and API testing methodologies, contributing to my technical expertise and understanding of the
					software development lifecycle.</p>

				<p>Previously, I was working as a Research Intern at the Energy, Power & Sustainability-Intelligence
					(EPSi) Laboratory, where I specialized in HIL simulations for power grids. I designd setups using
					advanced hardware/software and develop machine learning algorithms for island detection. I have
					proven expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and real-time integration into HIL
					testing setups. I was dedicated to enhancing power grid stability and reliability through iterative
					improvement and adaptive learning.</p>

						<h2>Minecraft clone in C++ using OpenGL</h2>
						<p>In this project, I've made significant progress in creating a Minecraft-inspired game using
							C++ and OpenGL. I've successfully implemented block rendering to display textured blocks in
							the game world. Additionally, I've developed player movement controls and collision
							detection to ensure the player interacts realistically with the environment. Through
							meticulous coding and testing, I've achieved smooth gameplay experiences, laying a solid
							foundation for further enhancements and feature additions. This project has deepened my
							understanding of graphics programming and game development, reinforcing my skills in
							problem-solving and software engineering.</p>

						<h2>A* Pathfinding Visualizer </h2>
						<p>Designed a grid-based map using Java Swing Library, where each cell represents a specific

							specify a beginning point,
							indicated in grey, and an ending point, indicated in black. The objective is to avoid
							obstacles and find the shortest route
							between the beginning and finishing points.
